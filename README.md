Philippe Van de Putte and Charles Rutkowski worked on this. 
It prompts the user for their name and age. 
It then responds with a message saying "Hi, name! You are age years old."

Code:

whatname="What is your name?"
nameprompt=input(whatname)
helloname= "Hi, " + nameprompt + "!"
age="What is your age?"
ageprompt=input(age)
helloage=" You are " + ageprompt + " years old!" 
print(helloname + helloage)

Output:
What is your name? Charlie
What is your age? 19
Hi, Charlie! You are 19 years old!
